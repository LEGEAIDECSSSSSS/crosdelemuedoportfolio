                <h3>Applying Filters to SQL Queries</h3>
                <p>
                    Data security and access control are critical aspects of any organization's IT infrastructure.
                    In this project, I utilized SQL queries to filter and analyze login attempts and employee data
                    to enhance security monitoring and facilitate system updates. By applying filters with SQL operators
                    such as <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, and <strong>LIKE</strong>, I was able to extract
                    meaningful insights, detect suspicious activities, and streamline administrative tasks. The following sections
                    detail the various filtering techniques used and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
                </p>                

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Failed Login Attempts After Hours</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A potential security breach may have occurred outside of regular working hours (after 18:00). To investigate unauthorized access attempts, I needed to filter out all failed login attempts that took place after business hours.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with AND to find failed logins after 18:00.</li>
                        <li>Query filters unsuccessful attempts for security review.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query1'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query1" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- This query filters login attempts that:
- Happened <strong>after 18:00</strong>.
- Were <strong>unsuccessful</strong>.
- This helps identify unauthorized access attempts outside working hours.
                        </pre>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Login Attempts on Specific Dates</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A suspicious event was reported on May 9, 2022. To analyze any potential security threats, I needed to retrieve all login attempts that occurred on May 9, 2022, and the day before (May 8, 2022), to check for any unusual activity leading up to the event.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigated suspicious logins on May 8–9, 2022.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with OR to extract logs.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query2'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query2" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08'; 

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- This query extracts all login attempts that occurred on either of the two 
  specified dates using the <strong>OR</strong> operator. 
- This helps track any unusual login patterns leading up to the event.
                        </pre>  
                    </ul>      

                    <li>Login Attempts Outside Mexico</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Unauthorized logins from foreign locations posed a security risk to the organization. I needed to extract all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico to identify potential account compromise or unauthorized access from international locations.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flagged all non-Mexico logins for investigation.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with NOT LIKE to extract logs.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query3'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query3" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%'; 

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- This query selects all login attempts excluding those from Mexico. 
- The NOT LIKE 'MEX%' condition ensures that logins from "MEX" and "MEXICO" are 
  filtered out, leaving only logins from other countries for further investigation.
                        </pre>  
                    </ul>

                    <li>Filtering Employees by Department</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The IT team needed to update computers for employees in <strong>Marketing, Finance, Sales, and IT</strong>. Different security updates were required based on department.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retrieved lists of employees in Marketing, Finance, Sales, and IT for system updates.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE, LIKE, AND, and OR operators.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query4'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query4" style="display: none;">
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department IN ('Marketing', 'Finance', 'Sales', 'IT');

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Uses the <strong>IN</strong> operator to retrieve employees from multiple departments at once.
- Instead of multiple <strong>OR</strong> conditions, <strong>IN</strong> makes the query more readable and efficient.
- Ensures that only employees from these four departments are included for security updates.
                        </pre>        
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I demonstrated how to apply SQL filtering techniques to extract security-critical data efficiently.
                    By utilizing SQL operators like <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, and <strong>LIKE</strong>, I was able to identify suspicious login attempts, analyze login trends,
                    and retrieve employee data based on departmental needs. These queries play a crucial role in strengthening security monitoring,
                    helping organizations proactively respond to potential threats and maintain data integrity.

                    <h3>File Permissions in Linux</h3>
                    <p>
                        Managing file permissions is essential for securing sensitive data. In this project, 
                        I used Linux commands to check and modify file permissions, ensuring proper authorization. 
                        Below are the key steps I took.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> I needed to verify permissions on important files in the projects directory.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used `ls -la` to check file and directory permissions.</li>

                            <pre id="linux1" style="display:none;">
                ls -la
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                - Lists all files and directories with their permissions.
                - Reveals hidden files by using the `-a` flag.
                            </pre>
                        </ul>
                
                        <li>Changing File Permissions</li>
                        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Some files allowed unwanted write access. I needed to modify their permissions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used `chmod` to remove write permissions from unauthorized users.</li>
                            <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('linux2'); return false;">Read Full Command →</a></p>

                chmod o-w project_k.txt
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                - This command removes write (`w`) permission from "others".
                - Ensures that only the owner and group can modify the file.
                            </pre>
                        </ul>
                
                        <li>Restricting Access to a Directory</li>
                        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Only `researcher2` should access the `drafts` directory.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used `chmod` to remove execute permissions from unauthorized users.</li>

                chmod g-x,o-x drafts/
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                - Removes execute permissions (`x`) for group and others.
                - Only the owner (`researcher2`) retains access.
                            </pre>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project highlights how file permissions in Linux can enhance security. By checking permissions,
                        modifying access levels, and enforcing proper restrictions, I ensured sensitive data remained protected.
