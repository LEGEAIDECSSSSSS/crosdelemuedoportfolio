                <h3>Applying Filters to SQL Queries</h3>
                <p>
                    Data security and access control are critical aspects of any organization's IT infrastructure.
                    In this project, I utilized SQL queries to filter and analyze login attempts and employee data
                    to enhance security monitoring and facilitate system updates. By applying filters with SQL operators
                    such as <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, and <strong>LIKE</strong>, I was able to extract
                    meaningful insights, detect suspicious activities, and streamline administrative tasks. The following sections
                    detail the various filtering techniques used and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
                </p>                

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Failed Login Attempts After Hours</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A potential security breach may have occurred outside of regular working hours (after 18:00). To investigate unauthorized access attempts, I needed to filter out all failed login attempts that took place after business hours.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with AND to find failed logins after 18:00.</li>
                        <li>Query filters unsuccessful attempts for security review.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query1'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query1" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- This query filters login attempts that:
- Happened <strong>after 18:00</strong>.
- Were <strong>unsuccessful</strong>.
- This helps identify unauthorized access attempts outside working hours.
                        </pre>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Login Attempts on Specific Dates</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A suspicious event was reported on May 9, 2022. To analyze any potential security threats, I needed to retrieve all login attempts that occurred on May 9, 2022, and the day before (May 8, 2022), to check for any unusual activity leading up to the event.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigated suspicious logins on May 8–9, 2022.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with OR to extract logs.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query2'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query2" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08'; 

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- This query extracts all login attempts that occurred on either of the two 
  specified dates using the <strong>OR</strong> operator. 
- This helps track any unusual login patterns leading up to the event.
                        </pre>  
                    </ul>      

                    <li>Login Attempts Outside Mexico</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Unauthorized logins from foreign locations posed a security risk to the organization. I needed to extract all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico to identify potential account compromise or unauthorized access from international locations.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flagged all non-Mexico logins for investigation.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE clause with NOT LIKE to extract logs.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query3'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query3" style="display:none;">
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%'; 

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- This query selects all login attempts excluding those from Mexico. 
- The NOT LIKE 'MEX%' condition ensures that logins from "MEX" and "MEXICO" are 
  filtered out, leaving only logins from other countries for further investigation.
                        </pre>  
                    </ul>

                    <li>Filtering Employees by Department</li>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The IT team needed to update computers for employees in <strong>Marketing, Finance, Sales, and IT</strong>. Different security updates were required based on department.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retrieved lists of employees in Marketing, Finance, Sales, and IT for system updates.</li>
                        <li>Used WHERE, LIKE, AND, and OR operators.</li>
                        <p><a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('query4'); return false;">Read Full Query →</a></p>
                        <pre id="query4" style="display: none;">
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department IN ('Marketing', 'Finance', 'Sales', 'IT');

<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Uses the <strong>IN</strong> operator to retrieve employees from multiple departments at once.
- Instead of multiple <strong>OR</strong> conditions, <strong>IN</strong> makes the query more readable and efficient.
- Ensures that only employees from these four departments are included for security updates.
                        </pre>        
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I demonstrated how to apply SQL filtering techniques to extract security-critical data efficiently.
                    By utilizing SQL operators like <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, and <strong>LIKE</strong>, I was able to identify suspicious login attempts, analyze login trends,
                    and retrieve employee data based on departmental needs. These queries play a crucial role in strengthening security monitoring,
                    helping organizations proactively respond to potential threats and maintain data integrity.

                    <h3>Update a File through a Python Algorithm</h3>
                    <p>
                      At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled by an allow list stored in "allow_list.txt". I developed a Python algorithm to automate updating this file by removing IP addresses found in a separate remove list.
                    </p>
                  
                    <h4>Project Description</h4>
                    <p>
                      The algorithm follows these key steps:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Open the File:</strong> Use Python's <code>open()</code> function in a <code>with</code> statement (read mode) to access the file contents.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Read the Contents:</strong> Convert the file's content into a string using the <code>.read()</code> method.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Convert to a List:</strong> Split the string into a list of IP addresses with the <code>.split()</code> method.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Iterate Through the Remove List:</strong> Loop through the remove list and check if each IP exists in the allow list.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Remove Matching IPs:</strong> Remove any IP addresses found in both lists using the <code>.remove()</code> method.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Update the File:</strong> Convert the updated list back to a string with the <code>.join()</code> method and overwrite the original file using <code>open()</code> in write mode.
                      </li>
                    </ol>

                  with open(import_file, "r") as file:
                      ip_addresses = file.read()
                    </pre>
                  
                    <p><strong>Updating the Allow List:</strong></p>
                    <a href="#" onclick="toggleQuery('pythonSnippet2'); return false;">Read Code Snippet</a>
                    <pre id="pythonSnippet2" style="display:none;">
                  # Convert string to list
                  ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()
                  
                  # Iterate through the remove list and remove matching IP addresses
                  for ip in remove_list:
                      if ip in ip_addresses:
                          ip_addresses.remove(ip)
                  
                  # Convert list back to string and update the file
                  ip_addresses = "\n".join(ip_addresses)
                  with open(import_file, "w") as file:
                      file.write(ip_addresses)
                    </pre>
                  
                    <p>
                      This Python algorithm automates updating the allow list to ensure that only authorized IP addresses remain, thereby improving content security.
